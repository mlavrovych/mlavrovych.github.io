            <h1>UKRAINE</h1>
            <p>Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. Kiev is its capital and largest city. 
                It has a total area of 603,550 square km. Ukrainian is its official language. 
                Its official currency is Ukrainian hryvnia (â‚´) (UAH). Its seven land bordering countries are 
                Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Russia, and Belarus. 
                The religion plays a strong influential role in shaping Ukrainian music, literature, 
                and architecture. 
            </p>
  
            <p>Although independence was achieved with the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, 
                true freedom remains difficult to grasp as many of the former Soviet elites remain deeply rooted 
                and block efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil rights.</p>
